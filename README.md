# ROS
An open-source, flexible framework for writing robot software. It provides tools, libraries, and conventions to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.
Basic Concepts

Robot Operating System (ROS): An open-source, flexible framework for writing robot software. It provides tools, libraries, and conventions to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

Arduino: An open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs and turn them into outputs, making them ideal for creating interactive projects.

Definitions
ROS Master: The central node in a ROS network that facilitates communication between different nodes by providing naming and registration services.
Node: An individual process in ROS that performs computation. Nodes communicate with each other by passing messages.
IDE (Integrated Development Environment): A software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development, including writing, debugging, and compiling code.
